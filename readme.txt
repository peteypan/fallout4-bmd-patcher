Disclaimer: I've never written Pascal/Delphi before this, so there was a fair amount of figuring it out, and I'm not a professional programmer either. I didn't want to spend hours inside xEdit tinkering with individual records, so I wrote this script, and now I'm sharing with others who might be in the same situation I am.

First off, I'm giving credit to Zzxyzz for creating this article:
http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/471/?

This inspired me to go into my own Fallout 4 installation, and figure out a way to merge the conflicts I've had with Better Locational Damage, Better Mod Descriptions, and Weaponsmith Extended 2 and have the weapon mod descriptions actually reflect the values they contain.

I took the script that Zzxyzz wrote for his BLD-patcher, and figured out how to make it such that I could read the OMOD properties and then generate text to put into the mod description.

The script is far from complete, but it's gotten me to where I need to my game. Feel free to comment/critique the code.
